# Test assignment project

Project is bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/)

Deployed to Netlify <https://vonq-test-assignment.netlify.com>

## Dev notes

- Used plain CSS (BEM methodology) without any preprocessors or libraries

## What can be improved?

- Make inputs validation more strict:
  - accept values for "No. of working hours" in range from 1 to 168
  - min hours has be to less than max hours value
- Apply red border on checkboxes when user submits the form without selecting "Level of education"
- Use some CSS-in-JS (e.g. [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/)) library for common components (Input, Button, Icon etc)
